"""
This part is a little more complicated.

If the length of our list(n value) is an even number,
we are going to get the two values in the middle of the
list. To do that we have to get the index numbers of 
those two values. Index value of the lesser one is n/2-1
and the bigger one is n/2 since index values are started 
from "0". Then we perform a simple addition and divide the
result by 2.

However if the length of the list(n value) is an odd number,
we are going to get only one number which is in the middle of
the list. We again substract 1 from n value since index numbers
start from "0" and then we divide It by 2 in order to get the
index value of the middle one.

And the rest is history
